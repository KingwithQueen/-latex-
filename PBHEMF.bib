abstract = {The model in which Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) constitute a non-negligible fraction of the dark matter has (re)gained popularity after the first detections of binary black hole mergers. Most of the observational constraints to date have been derived assuming a single mass for all the PBHs, although some more recent works tried to generalize constraints to the case of extended mass functions. Here we derive a general methodology to obtain constraints for any PBH Extended Mass Distribution (EMD) and any observables in the desired mass range. Starting from those obtained for a monochromatic distribution, we convert them into constraints for EMDs by using an equivalent, effective mass Meq that depends on the specific observable. We highlight how limits of validity of the PBH modelling affect the EMD parameter space. Finally, we present converted constraints on the total abundance of PBH from microlensing, stellar distribution in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and CMB accretion for Lognormal and Power Law mass distributions, finding that EMD constraints are generally stronger than monochromatic ones.}

First we review the formation of PBHs in the early Universe, focussing mainly on PBHs formed via the collapse of large density perturbations generated by inflation. Then we review the various current and future constraints on the present day abundance of PBHs. We conclude with a discussion of the key open questions in this field.}

We investigate the hypothesis that such excesses are due to primordial black holes (PBHs) that may constitute a substantial fraction of dark matter (DM). We present a novel semi-analytical model that predicts X-ray and radio emission due to gas accretion on to PBHs, assuming that they are distributed both inside DM haloes and in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Our model includes a self-consistent treatment of heating/ionization feedback on the surrounding environment. We find that (i) the emission from PBHs accreting in the IGM is subdominant at all times (\\$1\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\} \\le I\_\\{\\rm IGM\\}/I\_\\{\\rm tot\\} \\le 40\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$); (ii) most of the CXB/CRB emission comes from PBHs in DM mini-haloes (Mh ≤ 106 M⊙) at early epochs (\\$z\\$ \\&gt; 6). While a small fraction (\\$f\_\\{\\rm PBH\\} \\simeq 0.3\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$) of DM in the form of PBHs can account for the total observed CXB excess, the CRB one cannot be explained by PBHs.

abstract = {Big bang nucleosynthesis has long provided the primary determination of the cosmic baryon density ΩBh2, or equivalently the baryon-to-photon ratio, η. Recently, data on CMB anisotropies have become increasingly sensitive to η. The comparison of these two independent measures provides a key test for big bang cosmology. The first release of results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) marks a milestone in this test. With the precision of WMAP, the CMB now offers a significantly stronger constraint on η. We discuss the current state of BBN theory and light element observations (including their possible lingering systematic errors). The resulting BBN baryon density prediction is in overall agreement with the WMAP prediction, an important and non-trivial confirmation of hot big bang cosmology. Going beyond this, the powerful CMB baryometer can be used as an input to BBN and one can accurately predict the primordial light element abundances. By comparing these with observations one can obtain new insight into post-BBN nucleosynthesis processes and associated astrophysics. Finally, one can test the possibility of nonstandard physics at the time of BBN, now with all light elements available as probes. Indeed, with the WMAP precision η, deuterium is already beginning to rival 4He's sensitivity to nonstandard physics, and additional D/H measurements can improve this further.}

Hawking evaporation of such PBHs produces with a steady rate γ- and e±-radiations in MeV energy range, which can be absorbed by ordinary matter. Simplified estimates show that a small fraction of evaporated energy had to be absorbed by baryonic matter what can turn out to be enough to heat the matter so it is fully ionized at the redshift z∼ 5… 10. The result is found to be close to a borderline case where the effect appears, what makes it sensitive to the approximation used. In our approximation, degree of gas ionization reaches 50-100% by z∼ 5 for PBH mass (3…7)× 1016 g with their abundance corresponding to the upper limit.}

A recently proposed possibility to produce Planck relics in four-dimensional string gravity is considered in this framework. Possible experimental detection of PBHs through gravitational waves is also explored. We stress that inflation with a low energy scale, and also possibly when Planck relics are produced, leads unavoidably to relics originating from PBHs that are not effectively classical during their formation, rendering the usual formalism inadequate for them.},

Growing-mode perturbations are specified within the linear regime and their subsequent evolution is followed as they become nonlinear. We use a spherically symmetric Lagrangian code and study both super-critical perturbations, which go on to produce black holes, and sub-critical perturbations, for which the overdensity eventually disperses into the background medium. For super-critical perturbations, we confirm the results of previous work concerning scaling laws but note that the threshold amplitude for a perturbation to lead to black-hole formation is substantially reduced when the initial conditions are taken to represent purely growing modes. For sub-critical cases, where an initial collapse is followed by a subsequent re-expansion, strong compressions and rarefactions are seen for perturbation amplitudes near to the threshold. We have also investigated the effect of including a significant component of vacuum energy and have calculated the resulting changes in the threshold and in the slope of the scaling law.}

abstract = {Following on after two previous papers discussing the formation of primordial black holes in the early universe, we present here results from an in-depth investigation of the extent to which primordial black hole formation in the radiative era can be considered as an example of the critical collapse phenomenon. We focus on initial supra-horizon-scale perturbations of a type which could have come from inflation, with only a growing component and no decaying component. In order to study perturbations with amplitudes extremely close to the supposed critical limit, we have modified our previous computer code with the introduction of an adaptive mesh refinement scheme. This has allowed us to follow black hole formation from perturbations whose amplitudes are up to eight orders of magnitude closer to the threshold than we could do before. We find that scaling-law behaviour continues down to the smallest black hole masses that we are able to follow and we see no evidence of shock production such as has been reported in some previous studies and which led there to a breaking of the scaling-law behaviour at small black hole masses. We attribute this difference to the different initial conditions used. In addition to the scaling law, we also present other features of the results which are characteristic of critical collapse in this context.}

journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {This work is part of an ongoing research programme to study possible primordial black hole (PBH) formation during the radiation-dominated era of the early universe. Working within spherical symmetry, we specify an initial configuration in terms of a curvature profile, which represents initial conditions for the large amplitude metric perturbations, away from the homogeneous Friedmann–Robertson–Walker model, which are required for PBH formation. Using an asymptotic quasi-homogeneous solution, we relate the curvature profile with the density and velocity fields, which at an early enough time, when the length scale of the configuration is much larger than the cosmological horizon, can be treated as small perturbations of the background values. We present general analytic solutions for the density and velocity profiles. These solutions enable us to consider in a self-consistent way the formation of PBHs in a wide variety of cosmological situations with the cosmological fluid being treated as an arbitrary mixture of different components with different equations of state. We obtain the analytical solutions for the density and velocity profiles as functions of the initial time. We then use two different parametrizations for the curvature profile and follow numerically the evolution of initial configurations.}

The mass of PBHs produced in this mechanism with an appreciable density are distributed at certain intervals depending on the model parameters. We also calculate the effects of non-Gaussian statistics due to higher-order interactions on the abundance of PBHs, which turns out to be small.}

abstract = {Primordial black holes could have been formed in the early universe from sufficiently large cosmological perturbations re-entering the horizon when the Universe is still radiation dominated. These originate from the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated during inflation at small-scales. Because of the non-linear relation between the curvature perturbation ζ and the overdensity δρ, the formation of the primordial black holes is affected by intrinsic non-Gaussianity even if the curvature perturbation is Gaussian. We investigate the impact of this non-Gaussianity on the critical threshold δc which measures the excess of mass of the perturbation, finding a relative change with respect to the value obtained using a linear relation between ζ and δρ, of a few percent  suggesting that the value of the critical threshold is rather robust against non-linearities. The same holds also when local primordial non-Gaussianity, with fNL≳−3/2, are added to the curvature perturbation.}

abstract = {The standard deviation of the initial values of the nondimensional Kerr parameter a* of primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed in the radiation-dominated phase of the universe is estimated to the first order of perturbation for the narrow power spectrum. Evaluating the angular momentum at turnaround based on linearly extrapolated transfer functions and peak theory, we obtain the expression  , where MH, β0(MH), and γ are the mass within the Hubble horizon at the horizon entry of the overdense region, the fraction of the universe which collapsed to PBHs at the scale of MH, and a quantity that characterizes the width of the power spectrum, respectively. This implies that for M ≃ MH, the higher the probability of the PBH formation, the larger the standard deviation of the spins, while PBHs of M ≪ MH that formed through near-critical collapse may have larger spins than those of M ≃ MH. In comparison to the previous estimate, the new estimate has an explicit dependence on the ratio M/MH and no direct dependence on the current dark matter density. On the other hand, it suggests that the first-order effect can be numerically comparable to the second-order one.}

We find that the enhancement peaks at approximately 0.7M⊙, with the formation rate increasing by at least two orders of magnitude due to the softening of the equation of state at this time, with a range of approximately 0.3M⊙&lt;M&lt;1.4M⊙ at full width half-maximum. PBH formation is increased by a smaller amount for PBHs with masses spanning a large range, 10−3M⊙&lt;MPBH&lt;103M⊙, which includes the masses of the BHs that LIGO detected. The most significant source of uncertainty in the number of PBHs formed is now due to unknowns in the formation process, rather than from the phase transition. A near scale-invariant density power spectrum tuned to generate a population with mass and merger rate consistent with that detected by LIGO should also produce a much larger energy density of PBHs with solar mass. The existence of  BHs below the Chandresekhar mass limit would be a smoking gun for a primordial origin and they could arguably constitute a significant fraction of the cold dark matter density.  They also pose a challenge to inflationary model building which seek to produce the LIGO BHs without overproducing lighter PBHs.}

Here we show, with a simple toy model, that it is also possible to generate a peak in the curvature power spectrum of single-field inflation. We assume that the effective dynamics of the inflaton field presents a near-inflection point which slows down the field right before the end of inflation and gives rise to a prominent spike in the fluctuation power spectrum at scales much smaller than those probed by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure (LSS) observations. This peak will give rise, upon reentry during the radiation era, to PBH via gravitational collapse. The mass and abundance of these PBH is such that they could constitute the totality of the Dark Matter today. We satisfy all CMB and LSS constraints and predict a very broad range of PBH masses. Some of these PBH are light enough that they will evaporate before structure formation, leaving behind a large curvature fluctuation on small scales. This broad mass distribution of PBH as Dark Matter will be tested in the future by AdvLIGO and LISA interferometers.}

abstract = {Recently, it has been claimed that inflationary models with an inflection point in the scalar potential can produce a large resonance in the power spectrum of curvature perturbation. In this paper however we show that the previous analyses are incorrect. The reason is twofold: firstly, the inflaton is over-shot from a stage of standard inflation and so deviates from the slow-roll attractor before reaching the inflection. Secondly, on the (or close to) the inflection point, the ultra-slow-roll trajectory supersede the slow-roll one and thus, the slow-roll approximations used in the literature cannot be used. We then reconsider the model and provide a recipe for how to produce nevertheless a large peak in the matter power spectrum via fine-tuning of parameters.}

abstract = {We present a mechanism for the origin of the large-scale curvature perturbation in our Universe by the late decay of a massive scalar field, the curvaton. The curvaton is light during a period of cosmological inflation, when it acquires a perturbation with an almost scale-invariant spectrum. This corresponds initially to an isocurvature density perturbation, which generates the curvature perturbation after inflation when the curvaton density becomes a significant fraction of the total. The isocurvature density perturbation disappears if the curvaton completely decays into thermalised radiation. Any residual isocurvature perturbation is 100% correlated with the curvature. The same mechanism can also generate the curvature perturbation in pre-big bang/ekpyrotic models, provided that the curvaton has a suitable non-canonical kinetic term so as to generate a flat spectrum.}

It is demonstrated that ‘hydrodynamic’ effects may drastically alter the character of the instability; in particular, the dependence of the instability growth rate on perturbation wavenumber may become non-monotone. The non-linear stage of instability development is analysed half-quantitatively. It is demonstrated that, the ‘hydrodynamics’ being stabilizing, the instability growth may result in establishing stable spatially periodic structures in the one-dimensional situation.

We also show bounds from LIGO and to be expected from LISA and BBO. Current estimates for the gravitational wave background from supermassive black hole binaries are at the level where a PTA detection is expected. But if PTAs do observe a background soon, it will be difficult in the short term to distinguish black holes from cosmic strings as the source, because the spectral indices from the two sources happen to be quite similar. If PTAs do not observe a background, then the limits on Gμ will improve somewhat, but a string network with Gμ substantially below 10−11 will produce gravitational waves primarily at frequencies too high for PTA observation, so significant further progress will depend on intermediate-frequency observatories such as LISA, DECIGO and BBO.}

We then obtain an exact analytical expression for the probability of collapse to black holes for the Turok strings. Our result has the same general behavior as previously obtained in the literature but we find, in addition, a numerical prefactor that changes the result by three orders of magnitude. Finally we show that our careful computation of the prefactor helps us to understand the discrepancy between previously obtained results and, in particular, that for "large" values of Gμ, there may not even be a discrepancy. We also give a simple physical argument that can immediately rule out some of the previously obtained results. }

title = {Primordial black holes from cosmic necklaces},
journal = {Journal of High Energy Physics},
abstract = {Cosmic necklaces are hybrid topological defects consisting of monopoles and strings.  We argue that primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed from loops of the necklaces, if there exist stable winding states, such as coils and cycloops.  Unlike the standard scenario of PBH formation from string loops, in which the kinetic energy play important role when strings collapse into black holes, the PBH formation may occur in our scenario after necklaces have dissipated their kinetic energy.  Then, the significant difference appears in the production ratio.  In the standard scenario, the production ratio f becomes a tiny fraction  f ∼ 10−20 , however it becomes  f ∼ 1 in our case.  On the other hand, the typical mass of the PBHs is much smaller than the standard scenario, if they are produced in the same epoch.  As the two mechanisms may work at the same time, the necklaces may have more than one channel of the gravitational collapse.  Although the result obtained in this paper depends on the evolution of the dimensionless parameter r, the existence of the winding state could be a serious problem in some cases.  Since the existence of the winding state in brane models is due to the existence of a non-tivial circle in the compactified space, the PBH formation can be used to probe the structure of the compactified space.  Black holes produced by this mechanism may have peculiar properties.}

We find that PBH formation occurs at early times in a small window, whilst at late times we observe the formation of dark matter relics in the scaling regime.  This is in stark contrast to previous predictions based on field theoretic models.  We also consider the PBH contribution to the mass density of the universe, and use the experimental data to impose bounds on the string theory parameters.}

title = {Analytic description of primordial black hole formation from scalar field fragmentation},
journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Primordial black hole (PBH) formation is a more generic phenomenon than was once thought.  The dynamics of a scalar field in inflationary universe can produce PBHs under mild assumptions regarding the scalar potential. In the early universe, light scalar fields develop large expectation values during inflation and subsequently relax to the minimum of the effective potential at a later time. During the relaxation process, an initially homogeneous scalar condensate can fragment into lumps via an instability similar to the gravitational (Jeans) instability, where the scalar self-interactions, rather than gravity, play the leading role.  The fragmentation of the scalar field into lumps (e.g. Q-balls or oscillons) creates matter composed of relatively few heavy “particles”, whose distribution is subject to significant fluctuations unconstrained by comic microwave background (CMB) observations and unrelated to the large-scale structure.  If this matter component comes to temporarily dominate the energy density before the scalar lumps decay, PBHs can be efficiently produced during the temporary matter-dominated era. We develop a general analytic framework for description of PBH formation in this class of models. We highlight the differences between the scalar fragmentation scenario and other  commonly considered PBH formation models. Given the existence of the Higgs field and the preponderance of scalar fields within supersymmetric and other models of new physics, PBHs constitute an appealing and plausible candidate for dark matter.}

Limits imposed by big-bang nucleosynthesis on the abundance of these particles are used to constrain the initial PBH mass fraction β (ratio of PBH energy density to critical energy density at formation), as: β≲5×10−19(xφ/6·10−3)−1(MBH/109g)−1/2(Yφ/10−14); xφ is the fraction of PBH luminosity going into gravitinos or moduli, Yφ is the upper bound imposed by nucleosynthesis on the number density to entropy density ratio of gravitinos or moduli. This notably implies that such PBHs should never come to dominate the cosmic energy density.}

We show that the CMB anisotropies can provide stronger   constraints compared to BBN and CMB spectral distortions on black   holes with masses as small as MBH=1.1× 1013 g, a   slightly smaller mass than what has been considered in literature   until now. We also show that, with more up-to-date data on   abundances of deuterium and helium-3, BBN constraints are   strengthened significantly. The abundance of these primordial black   holes constrains the epoch of inflation 0∼ 4 e-folds after the   epoch constrained by the CMB observations.}

    abstract = "{Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a unique tool for learning about the early phases of cosmic history, reaching deep into the primordial Universe. At redshifts z ≲ 106, thermalization processes become inefficient and existing limits from COBE/FIRAS imply that no more than Δρ/ρ ≲ 6 × 10−5 (\\$95\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ c.l.) of energy could have been injected into the CMB. However, at higher redshifts, when thermalization is efficient, the constraint weakens and Δρ/ρ ≃ 0.01−0.1 could in principle have occurred. Existing computations for the evolution of distortions commonly assume Δρ/ρ ≪ 1 and thus become inaccurate in this case. Similarly, relativistic temperature corrections become relevant for large energy release, but have previously not been modelled as carefully. Here, we study the evolution of distortions and the thermalization process after single large energy release at z ≳ 105. We show that for large distortions the thermalization efficiency is significantly reduced and that the distortion visibility is sizeable to much earlier times. This tightens spectral distortions constraints on low-mass primordial black holes with masses \\$M\_\\{\\rm PBH\\}\\lesssim 2 \\times 10^\\{11\\}\\, \\{\\rm g\\}\\$. Similarly, distortion limits on the amplitude of the small-scale curvature power spectrum at wavenumbers \\$k\\gtrsim 10^4\\, \\{\\rm Mpc\\}^\\{-1\\}\\$ and short-lived decaying particles with lifetimes \\$t\_X\\lesssim 10^7\\, \\{\\rm s\\}\\$ are tightened, however, these still require a more detailed time-dependent treatment. We also briefly discuss the constraints from measurements of the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and light element abundances and how these complement spectral distortion limits.}",
