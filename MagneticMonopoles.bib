   abstract = "Searches for magnetic monopoles (s) are a fascinating interdisciplinary area with implications for fundamental theories, particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The quantum theory of s, and its consistency with electrodynamics, was originally derived by Dirac, marking the beginning of the search for classical monopoles at every new accelerator, including the Large Hadron Collider. s are required by Grand Unification Theories (GUTs), but unlike classical monopoles they would be incredibly massive, out of reach for any conceivable accelerator. Significant effort has been made to search for s in the cosmic radiation as relic particles from the early Universe in the widest experimentally available range of mass and velocity. In this review, we discuss the status of the searches for classical s at accelerators for GUTs, superheavy s in the penetrating cosmic radiation, and intermediate-mass s at high altitudes, emphasizing the most recent results and future perspectives.",

abstract = {During the past three years there has been an intense search for slow, massive magnetic monopoles, presumed to be the oldest observable relics of creation. There is little theoretical guidance as to their expected flux, although such particles are mandatory in a large class of grand unified theories. We review experimental constraints. Superconducting induction experiments provide the most direct upper limit, 1.5 × 10−2 cm−2 sr−1 s−1 at the 90% confidence level, independently of velocity. A Russian group using a large scintillation counter array reports F ⪅ 2 × 10−15 cm −2 sr−1 s−1 for monopoles with velocities as low as 10−3 c, the local virial velocity in the galaxy. A search for tracks in ancient muscovite mica establishes a limit near 10−19 cm−2 sr−1 s−1 at this velocity, albeit with some interpretative problems. These terrestrial bounds are to be compared with the Parker limit at ∼10−15 cm−2 sr−1 s−1 (over most of the expected mass range), a bound at 10−19 cm−2 sr−1 s−1 if magnetic fields survive in clusters of galaxies, and with several limits based upon neutron star observations—∼10−22 cm−2 sr−1 s−1 if nucleon decay is or is not catalyzed by monopoles. New induction, scintillation, and proportional wire chamber experiments are in their late construction stages, and a very large array of He-n-pentane streamer chambers, track etch detectors, and scintillators has been proposed. This active and exciting field would be even further stimulated by the discovery of monopoles.}

The theoretical models include, apart from the standard Grand Unified Theories, extensions of the Standard Model that admit magnetic monopole solutions with finite energy and masses that can be as light as a few TeV. Specifically, we discuss, among other scenarios, modified Cho–Maison monopoles and magnetic monopoles in (string-inspired, higher derivative) Born–Infeld extensions of the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model. We also outline the conditions for which effective field theories describing the interaction of monopoles with photons are valid and can be used for result interpretation in monopole production at colliders. The experimental part of the review focuses on, past and present, cosmic and collider searches, including the latest bounds on monopole masses and magnetic charges by the ATLAS and MoEDAL experiments at the LHC, as well as prospects for future searches. }

abstract = {Existing theoretical and observational constraints on the abundance of magnetic monopoles are limited. Here we demonstrate that an ensemble of monopoles forms a plasma whose properties are well determined and whose collective effects place new tight constraints on the cosmological abundance of monopoles. In particular, the existence of micro-Gauss magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and radio relics implies that the scales of these structures are below the Debye screening length, thus setting an upper limit on the cosmological density parameter of monopoles, ΩM ≲ 3 × 10−4, which precludes them from being the dark matter. Future detection of Gpc-scale coherent magnetic fields could improve this limit by a few orders of magnitude. In addition, we predict the existence of magnetic Langmuir waves and turbulence which may appear on the sky as ``zebra patterns'' of an alternating magnetic field with k·B ≠ 0. We also show that magnetic monopole Langmuir turbulence excited near the accretion shock of galaxy clusters may be an efficient mechanism for generating the observed intracluster magnetic fields.}

abstract = {We calculate the full probability density function (PDF) of inflationary curvature perturbations, even in the presence of large quantum backreaction. Making use of the stochastic-δ N formalism, two complementary methods are developed, one based on solving an ordinary differential equation for the characteristic function of the PDF, and the other based on solving a heat equation for the PDF directly. In the classical limit where quantum diffusion is small, we develop an expansion scheme that not only recovers the standard Gaussian PDF at leading order, but also allows us to calculate the first non-Gaussian corrections to the usual result. In the opposite limit where quantum diffusion is large, we find that the PDF is given by an elliptic theta function, which is fully characterised by the ratio between the squared width and height (in Planck mass units) of the region where stochastic effects dominate. We then apply these results to the calculation of the mass fraction of primordial black holes from inflation, and show that no more than ∼ 1 e-fold can be spent in regions of the potential dominated by quantum diffusion. We explain how this requirement constrains inflationary potentials with two examples.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Primordial black-holes (PBH) can be produced in single-field models of inflation with a quasi-inflection point in the potential. In these models, a large production of PBHs requires a deviation from the slow-roll (SR) trajectory. In turn, this SR violation can produce an exponential growth of quantum fluctuations. We study the back-reaction of these quantum modes on the inflationary dynamics using stochastic inflation in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We develop a methodology to solve quantum diffusion beyond SR in terms of the statistical moments of the probability distribution. We apply these techniques to a toy model potential with a quasi-inflection point. We find that there is an enhancement of the power spectrum due to the dominance of the stochastic noise in the phase beyond SR. Moreover, non-Gaussian corrections become as well relevant with a large positive kurtosis. Altogether, this produces a significant boost of PBH production. We discuss how our results extend to other single-field models with similar dynamics. We conclude that the abundance of PBHs in this class of models should be revisited including quantum diffusion.}

As no such increase is observed on cosmological scales, black hole formation requires strongly positive running n′ of the spectral index n, though the running might only kick in below the ‘cosmological scales’ probed by the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and galaxy surveys. A concrete and well-motivated way of producing this running is through the running mass model of slow-roll inflation. We obtain a new observational bound n′&lt;0.026  on the running provided by this model, improving an earlier result by a factor 2. We also discuss black hole production in more general scenarios.

These oscillations trigger a resonant instability for   cosmological perturbations with wavelengths that exit the Hubble radius close to the end of   inflation. In this paper, we study the formation of Primordial Black   Holes (PBHs) at these enhanced scales. We find that the production   mechanism can be so efficient that PBHs subsequently dominate the content of the universe and   reheating proceeds from their evaporation.   Observational constraints on the PBH abundance also restrict the   duration of the resonant instability phase, leading to tight limits on the reheating temperature   that we derive. We conclude that the production of PBHs during reheating is a generic and inevitable   property of the simplest inflationary single-field models, and does not require any fine tuning of the inflationary potential.}

In this paper we show that, in supersymmetric theories with weak-scale supersymmetry breaking, one can construct viable inflationary models in which the requisite parameters appear naturally in the form of the ratio of mass scales that are already present in the theory. Successful inflationary models can be constructed from the flat-direction fields of a renormalizable supersymmetric potential, and such models can be realized even in the context of a simple GUT extension of the MSSM. We evade naive “naturalness” arguments by allowing for more than one field to be relevant to inflation, as in “hybrid inflation” models, and we argue that this is the most natural possibility if inflaton fields are to be associated with flat direction fields of a supersymmetric theory. Such models predict a very low Hubble constant during inflation, of order 103–104 GeV, a scalar density perturbation index n which is very close to or greater than unity, and negligible tensor perturbations. In addition, these models lead to a large spike in the density perturbation spectrum at short wavelengths.}

At the same time, it posed one of the most profound mysteries in all of science, with deep connections to both astrophysics and particle physics. Cosmic acceleration could arise from the repulsive gravity of dark energy—for example, the quantum energy of the vacuum—or it may signal that general relativity (GR) breaks down on cosmological scales and must be replaced. We review the present observational evidence for cosmic acceleration and what it has revealed about dark energy, discuss the various theoretical ideas that have been proposed to explain acceleration, and describe the key observational probes that will shed light on this enigma in the coming years.",
